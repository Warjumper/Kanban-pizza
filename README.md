# Kanban Pizza Party

## Outline

Kanban Pizza Party is a 2 step game where you are going to document the steps needed to make a pizza using a Github Project Board.

In step 1, you will work with 1 other person to create a Github project and set up tasks needed to make a pizza. You and your partner can decided on however you want to do this together - set up steps that you two see as necessary.

In Step 2, you will go into a group with 1 other pair, you will share your Kanban Pizza Instructions with one another so that each pair is working on the other's kanban board. The goal is to use the commenting feature to ask questions or make notes on how you would accomplish this task (be as detailed or as vague as you want). By the end, every task should have at least 1 comment with a statement or clarifying question.

Your board should use issues set up in a Github Project, enrich them with labels and helpful descriptions. **Include a "Definition of Done**" for each task - even if it's literally 1 checkbox/point

### Details
- Time: 1 hour
  - part 1: 40 minutes
  - part 2: 20 minutes
- Number of Players: 4
- Software: Github Projects
- Requirements
  - A github account

### Objective
- Create a kanban board and organize issues on it
- Engage with someone elses' kanban board by commenting

## How to Play

### Stage 1
1. Either your partner or you will take lead on setting up a github project and inviting the other person to it
2. Decide on the type of Pizza that you plan to make
3. Create a couple labels for important stages of making a pizza
  - ie: `prep`, `bake`, `wait`, `store` (it's however it makes sense to you and your partner)
  - Remember that you can create more labels as you go, Github will give you a few to work from that you can change or delete
4. Create issues for the different tasks that go into making a pizza
  - Add a title
  - add a description that includes a **Context** and a **Definition of Done**
  - attach any labels
5. Make sure to make notes of any tasks that are blocked by other tasks (ie: you can't bake a crust if the dough isn't ready)
6. Test your board by moving through it in real time together
  - Each of you will select cards and move them over, through the stages as if you were making a pizza together
7. If you run into issues with your structure, make minor changes so the flow feels more intuitive

### Stage 2
1. Meet with another pair and exchange project boards (you'll need to add each other to the project so that they can edit)
2. Take turns working through each others boards (1 at a time)
  - While a pair is in progress, you can't talk to them, you can only interact through the comment section on the cards
3. While using the other pair's board, assign tasks to one another in a way that makes sense to you and go through the project as you did your own in stage 1
  - In the comment section, add a brief note for how you approached your task
  - If you find the instructions unclear or confusing, message in the comment section (other team watch for questions and respond as quickly as you can)
4. If you have any remaining time when you've both finished making each other's pizzas, chat a bit about how your process may have differed
